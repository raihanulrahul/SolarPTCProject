# SolarPTCProject
This work presents the detailed calculations for exergetic and energetic analyses of a PTC based power plant. An approach based on exergy destruction and first law efficiency has been introduced for finding the optimum receiver temperature which is crucial for the collector-receiver subsystem calculations. This work is also focused on the investigation of effects of mass flowrate and inlet temperature of the HTF. For a specified solar aperture area, the net work output, first law efficiency and second law efficiencies have been presented as functions of mass flowrate. The limiting values of mass flowrates are presented which correspond to the stability temperature limit of the HTF for a given aperture area and plant capacity.
